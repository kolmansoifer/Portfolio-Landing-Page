    <h4>By Kolman Soifer</h4>
  </div>
  <h2>Welcome to my project landing page</h2>
  <p>Hello!  I'm a new <span class="highlight">Epicodus</span> student attending the August 2020 cohort.  This is my first foray into coding/programming and I couldn't be more <strong>excited</strong>!</p>  
  <p>Please see the following for a list of a few of my projects:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kolmansoifer/vacation-site">Vacation Packages Site</a></li>
      <p>This site is for a company that sells vacation packages.  I wrote this in HTML with some CSS components.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kolmansoifer/cupcake-shop">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
      <p>My daughter's dream is to open a bakery specializing in cupcakes and cupcakes <em>only</em>.  I also used HTML and CSS for this site.</p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/kolmansoifer/fish">Fishing Guide Site</a></li>
      <p>A friend of mine is a fishing guide in Alaska.  This is a link to his site.  As with the above, I used HTML and CSS.</p>
    </ul>
  <div class="b">
    <h2>A pledge to my valued clients</h2>
      <p>If you choose me to collaborate on your project, I pledge to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Communicate faithfully</li>
          <li>Bill only for the time I spend on your project</li>
          <li>Follow up consistently to ensure your site is healthy and performing as intended</li>
        </ol>
  </div>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>After a long career in the hopitality industry, I began to yearn for a new challenge and decided to pivot away from the hotel food and beverage business.  As excited as I am about this new challenge, I have many fond memories of my former life.</p>
    <p>See below for some pics of my family and I having fun and living our best life.</p>
